# Restoration plan

The [design contract](00-design%20notes.md#baselines-and-restoration-target) pins
production migration to `094a783a94b95ed4ec15089e9372763b7d59f66c` and functional/UX
parity to `f027830a9790`. Restore existing workflows on the target schema through
their existing components and server owners. Café Marché users should encounter
minimal UX changes. Temporary isolation and reduced screens do not establish parity.

## Gates and current position

| Gate | Acceptance | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A0: runnable development app | Normal typecheck/build, startup on disposable migrated data, login/dashboard/migrated page in the built browser, coherent boundaries for deferred surfaces. | Achieved 2026-10-08. |
| A1: everyday workflow parity | Reference member, event/invitation/attendance, song and associated-file workflows, including their supporting endpoints and browser interactions; isolation and required checks pass. | Open. |
| B: complete localization and multiband support | Routing, administration/lifecycle, translation tooling and agreed coverage; remaining obligations restored or explicitly retired; `yarn migration:check` passes. | Open. |

A0 is a development gate, not production readiness. Production cutover also
requires the supported production upgrade, required Café Marché workflows and
explicit acceptance of any remaining limitation.

Authorization, localization/presentation, typed settings and shared DB3 support
are available. Migrated catalogs, basic member/profile edits, membership status,
wiki content, menus, attendance/calendar endpoints, plan persistence, Custom Links,
telemetry and narrow downloads have implementation and verification evidence.
Preserve them while restoring their wider workflows. Basic member directory and
profile behavior is only a subset: reference filters, presets, contact-search
policy, exports and profile tabs remain A1 work.

Event setlist editing, general song/file screens, non-event domain search,
quick/shell search, publication, uploads and several reports/admin surfaces remain
guarded or incomplete. The
[restoration manifest](feature-restoration.json) records the individual obligations
and verification criteria; use `yarn migration:status` rather than maintaining a
second restriction table. Keep every deferred page, RPC/API, generic DB3 root,
startup/job and indirect caller coherently unavailable until its owner is safe.

## Event search checkpoint

The existing Events page, `SearchPageContent`, filter/list hooks,
`eventSearchConfig`, result cards and domain-search owner are active for
`Event_Search`. Reference presets/defaults, date/type/status/tag operators,
facets/counts, URL state, semantic sorting, load-more, refresh callbacks and
CSV/TSV export are retained. Rows, counts, facets and public references share a
freshly authorized band snapshot. Shared catalog views resolve localized labels,
inheritance and effective label ordering. Band/language changes abort old requests
and clear their results; event links and exports retain band/route locale.

Authored text matching remains active; localized catalog-name matching follows
the A1 exception below. Detail links retain the reference URLs and open the
restored detail page. Creation and pin/hide controls now use the restored write
owners. Text-only search exposes Reset filter, which also clears the text. These
checkpoints do not close event parity or A1; other domain-search roots remain guarded.

## Event detail and editing checkpoint

The existing detail page, breadcrumbs, tabs and creation/edit dialogs are active.
Page metadata and detail reads use shared snapshot authorization and localized
catalog references; absent, private, deleted and foreign-band events return 404.
Band changes remount detail state and discard previous query results. Event
creation, basic fields, visibility, pin/hide relevance, segment creation/date
editing/deletion and CafeMarche frontpage fields use explicit band/public targets
and the shared field authorization, audit and event-range services.
Creation retains the existing revision/frontpage initialization checks, requiring
`admin_events` and `edit_public_homepage` alongside `manage_events`; its button
now follows those checks. The dialog sends only creation fields and supplies the
first segment's name/description explicitly.

Invitation-group changes and the original invitation/attendance controls reuse
the migrated response owners. The person picker now selects band memberships,
rather than querying shared accounts. Existing setlist contents and recording
playback are available through independently authorized Song/File reads. Setlist
editing remains unavailable: its commands and child rows still need ownership
declarations, and saving depends on the deferred Song row service. Event Files
retains its viewer while upload/metadata actions remain unavailable. Dialog help
keys and draft tag associations were repaired so the original editors can open.

Remaining event parity includes setlist writes and song picking, date-picker
highlights, the full attendance/default-instrument interaction matrix and
publication consumers/imports. Editing frontpage fields does not restore the
anonymous homepage or feed. Localized catalog-name matching remains covered by
the A1 exception; these gaps keep `event-workflows` and A1 open.

## Next slice: songs and event setlist editing

Trace the reference Song search/detail/edit path and its File dependencies.
Restore their ownership through shared DB3 declarations and existing server/UI
owners, including nested setlist children and visible song references. Reactivate
the original event setlist editor only when save/delete/reorder and song picking
work across two bands. Retain the event and attendance checkpoints; account for
file previews, metadata/associations and uploads as concrete dependencies.

## Localized catalog text search exception

A1 may defer free-text matching against newly localized catalog names such as
tags, statuses, types and instruments. Omit only those predicates. Keep authored
and other nonlocalized text search, identity-based catalog filters and operators,
facets/counts, presets, URL state, sorting, presentation, paging/load-more and
exports. Resolve displayed labels through shared band/locale machinery; do not
query removed raw-name columns or add domain-specific fallback rules.

Account separately for localized-name ordering if it needs adaptation. Record the
omitted name matching in its owning manifest obligation; full matching remains
pending after A1. Keep already working resolved small-catalog searches active.
This exception does not justify disabling a search page or simplifying its UI.

Complete localization of existing site chrome is not required for A1. Keep
working labels, resolve migrated data labels, and use the registry for necessary
new text.

## Remaining sequence

Keep the app runnable and verify each slice immediately. Priorities may change
when a concrete workflow dependency requires it.

| Work | Required parity |
| --- | --- |
| Members | Existing directory filters/facets/presets/URL state/contact search/exports; profile tabs, account controls and activity, retaining migrated membership policy. |
| Events | Retain restored search/detail/creation/editing and invitation/attendance controls; finish default-instrument and attendance parity, event song-list editing and date-picker highlights. |
| Songs and files | Search/detail/editing, tags/credits, partitions/recordings, metadata/associations, previews, uploads and downloads. |
| Supporting workflows | Dashboard/wiki/custom navigation, plans, search, calendars/feeds/tokens, Custom Links, exports, telemetry and jobs used by core workflows. Account explicitly for remaining gaps. |

After core restoration: platform role/matrix and catalog/settings administration;
band onboarding/lifecycle; shared-account lifecycle/merge/dependency reports;
full portal routing; localized-name text matching; translation inventory/editing,
import/export and French/Dutch coverage. Existing workflow parity is not a new
enhancement. Optional product additions and optimizations remain separate.

## Slice acceptance and cutover

Before editing, inspect the reference path/tests and identify observable behavior
to preserve. Adapt shared contracts before adding domain machinery. Do not restore
obsolete models, add broad compatibility shims, narrow compiler coverage or
suppress errors to produce a passing build. Preserve any isolated implementation
and behavioral specifications in the same change using the
[preservation procedure](13-feature-preservation.md).

For each slice, pass normal typecheck/build, applicable lint and focused tests;
exercise the existing workflow in the built app on disposable data. Record only
reference behavior retained, schema-driven differences/accepted exceptions,
meaningful verification and unresolved gaps. Update this plan and the owning
manifest entry rather than appending a journal.

Use two bands sharing people/catalog items but differing in roles, private
content, locales, overrides and settings. Cover anonymous/member/roleless/manager/
platform/outsider/inactive/deleted/merged cases as relevant. Check ownership,
revoked grants, hidden references, caches and context switches at the server.
Localization checks include band-first scope, blanks, ordered route/browser
preferences, deterministic fallback and distinct preference lists sharing a
formatting locale. Locale support and translation coverage are separate claims.

Before accepting A1, assess the full repository suite and resolve failures or
update demonstrably obsolete contracts; do not blanket-skip deferred failures.
Verify core workflows and startup/fresh-install initialization. Use the
[testing conventions](../testing.md). Before production cutover, repeat the
[SQL runbook](03-sql-migration.md) on a current production copy, compare preserved
data, rehearse backup restoration and deploy the migrated database, app and
client together with writes stopped and matching upload backups.

## Verification status

The event-search checkpoint (2026-10-08) passed normal typecheck/build, focused
lint, 123 focused tests across 13 executable files and 30 native MariaDB tests
across four files. Native cases cover all tag operators, combined criteria,
stable paging, localized/blank/inherited facets, hidden/foreign references,
private/deleted events, revoked grants and anonymous/member/roleless/platform/
outsider/inactive/deleted/merged authorization boundaries. Seven built-browser
assertion groups passed on an isolated production demo build: Relevant/All/Past
concerts presets, 30-row paging, contextual links, TSV export, text/filter URL
reload, facet counts/sorting, French labels, Dutch second-band results and
ordinary-member access rejection. No uncaught browser errors occurred.

The event-detail checkpoint passed 294 focused tests across 15 executable files
and 162 native MariaDB tests across eight files, including real invitation-tag
assignments, parent-inherited segment ownership, audit/range updates, hidden and
foreign references, revoked grants, and independent pinned Song/File visibility.
Draft association tests cover new parents and invalid supplied IDs. Normal
typecheck/build and focused lint pass. Twelve assertion groups passed in the
isolated production demo browser: original detail/tab links, creation permission
gating and actual creation, basic/segment/date edits, invitation groups and member
selection, inline attendance, setlist contents and actual two-second WAV playback,
French frontpage saves/visibility, deferred File/setlist action boundaries and
Dutch second-band detail/ordinary-member controls with foreign-band 404s. No
uncaught browser or RPC errors occurred. The browser fixture supplies the existing
event-administration grant only for creation and removes it afterwards.

The complete-suite run still reports 214 failed tests and ten suite-load failures
in the Node batch, including authorization/account, deferred-domain and date-policy
contracts; the runner stops before the later jsdom batches. Focused passes do not
establish A1 readiness. Earlier built-browser member/profile/wiki/download checks
remain recorded evidence, not workflows rerun by these event slices.

The repeatable [demo workflow](../demo-seeding.md) has 29 configuration checks,
six native generator/reset checks, an isolated production build and five passing
built-browser assertion groups covering localized fallback/overrides, profile
writes, actual SVG/WAV delivery and foreign-band file rejection. Legacy generator
variants still need accounting under `demo-seeding`; none is retired. Production
seed/startup does not run demo generators or historical backfills.

`yarn migration:verify` protects the source inventory and deferred specifications;
it does not prove runtime parity. Full feature completion uses the separate
`yarn migration:check` gate.
