# Café Marché backstage Release v0.93

Markdown editing:

#421 added dialogs for editing references / wiki links / hyperlinks
#420 ctrl+enter now saves progress
preview is now always open
fixed: sometimes markdown editor height was too small
#418 hitting enter while editing a list continues the list
#417 refinement of icons, keyboard shortcuts, editing behaviors
#219 fixed: special formatting was sometimes conflicting, causing them to go unprocessed.
#245 URLs are automatically formatted as such without special markdown syntax (linkify)
#390 better support for pasting rich text (for example pasting from a word document)
#413 Removed abcjs support; it was causing the pages to be slow & heavy.

Setlists:

#415 setlists can now include items which are not actually songs but act like one (for example a "Happy Birthday" which is not in our repertoire but we want it to appear in a setlist anyway)
#391 #387 fixed various setlist mobile accessibility and formatting issues

Events pages

#398 event attendance responses tables now also show count of people who responded "not going"
#393 added a menu to copy event URLs and direct link to iCal calendar subscriptions
#397 #406 event descriptions are now treated as wiki pages, with more sophisticated editing capabilities

General 

#384 added Thursday rehearsal info to the public homepage, as requested by vlamo via Leen
#24 added global search bar at the top of the screen
#395 #404 Added this week's events to the backstage homepage with direct links to info & setlists
#394 Backstage homepage announcement text is now editable as a wiki article
#414 #411 Improved "quick search": Unification across site, added relevance and other query methods like filtering by type, searching by tag, and id.
#409 many dialog buttons were inaccessible / off screen / difficult to see / too small on mobile
#408 disabling autofocus on mobile because phones will auto-show the on screen keyboard & zoom the page which is usually just distracting.

wiki

#401 wiki articles can now be placed under namespaces for better organization
#396 wiki page editing now enforces mutually-exclusive editing (to handle multiple people editing at the same time without silently clobering changes)
